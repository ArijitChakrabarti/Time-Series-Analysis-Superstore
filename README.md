<h1><center><bold>Time Series Forecasting Superstore Database </bold></center></h1>

This is a dataset from 'fivethirtyeight' - about a superstore which sells office supplies to both consumers, corporate and home offices.

The dataset is from 2014 to 2017.  I have processed it and tried to project their sales into 2017 - to improve my learning in time series analysis.
